;
; We test in two phases:
;
; 1. Check that the generated Python code is what we expect.
;

(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (package atdpy)
 (action
   (diff python-expected/everything.py
     python-tests/everything.py)))

; 2. Run the generated Python code and check that is reads or writes JSON
;    data as expected.
